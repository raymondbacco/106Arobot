## Tiffany Cappellari

Tiffany is a current third year EECS undergrad at UC Berkeley. She has previously taken the CS 61 series, the EE 16 series, and EE 120 and is currently working on the EE 16B course staff.
She designed and wrote a script to use the tf transforms from the camera and then calculate how far the tag is from the robot and at what angle it is. The script then tells the robot how to move in order to go to the tag. She also helped with calibrating the camera and downloading ROS packages.
