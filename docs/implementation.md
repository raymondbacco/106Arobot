### Xiao Robotics Tank Chassis

A strong aluminum alloy chassis with dual built in 6-15-volt geared DC Motors. Attached to the motors are two hard plastic tracks that span the length of the chassis. The chassis is heavy duty and has mounting holes and a large compartment between the dual tracks.

### Raspberry Pi 3 B+

The Raspberry Pi 3 B+ has a 64-bit quad core processor running at 1.4 Ghz. It incorporates built-in WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity with enhanced dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2/BLE and faster Ethernet.

### 7 “ Raspberry Pi Touchscreen

A 7” Touchscreen Display. Screen Dimensions: 194mm x 110mm x 20mm (including standoffs) Viewable screen size: 155mm x 86mm Screen Resolution 800 x 480 pixels 10 finger capacitive touch Connects to the Raspberry Pi board using a ribbon cable connected to the DSI port. Adapter board is used to power the display and convert the parallel signals from the display to the serial (DSI) port on the Raspberry Pi.

### Xbox 360 Kinect

The Kinect sensor is a horizontal bar connected to a small base with a motorized pivot and is designed to be positioned lengthwise above or below the video display. The device features an "RGB camera, depth sensor and multi-array microphone running proprietary software", which provide full-body 3D motion capture, facial recognition and voice recognition capabilities.

### PCA 9685 16 channel Servo Controller

The PCA9685 is an I2C-bus controlled 16-channel LED controller optimized for Red/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) color backlighting applications. Each LED output has its own 12-bit resolution (4096 steps) fixed frequency individual PWM controller that operates at a programmable frequency from a typical of 24 Hz to 1526 Hz with a duty cycle that is adjustable from 0 % to 100 % to allow the LED to be set to a specific brightness value.

### SunFounder Photo-interrupter Sensor Module

A photo-interrupter is a sensor that arranges light-emitting component and light-receiving component face-to-face and packages them together. It applies the principle that light is interrupted when an object passes through the sensor. Therefore, photo-interrupters are widely used in many fields like speed measurement.
