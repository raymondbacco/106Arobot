# Results

Our robot is able to locate and navigate to our desired object with consistent accuracy. If it cannot see the desired AR-tag in its field of view immediately, then it incrementally turns around with periodic pauses in between to look for the tag until it finds it, and then is able to navigate itself to the tag with precision and accuracy.
